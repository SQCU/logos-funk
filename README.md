# LOGOS-FUNK
# goals  
logos-funk set out to:  
Extend the animation routine in logos-test to multiple independent objects,  
generalize the routine for orbital motion so that adding 10x as many objects with independent positions  
and trajectories does not increase source code length by a factor of 10.  
Consider rewriting the orbital object routines in 'oop style'.  
Consider rewriting the orbital object routines in 'functional style' (list-passing, baby).  
Decide which implementation is more comfortable and legible and stick with it.  
In more concrete goals, make 4 things spin around a thing.  
Do all of these tasks in under 1 day, or approximately 4 hours of high-focus effort.  
# timeline
The 'monolithic enterprise java' coding style branch of logos-funk ate up a surprising amount of time!  
An entire afternoon on 12/4/2020( approximately 2 hours) was spent vacillating between the OOP meme and trying to make the program actually work in the imperative style.  
Artifacts of this terrible time can be found in the index-oop and logos-funk-oop files in the revision history.  
The next day, 12/5/2020, we dropped all pretenses of using "design patterns" and finished the routine with the tersest kludge possible.  
# results
Write code that doesn't scale.  
Refactoring will happen sooner or later, and the best time to start laying foundations and building frameworks is after you need them, not before the minimum working program.   
logos-funk generalized an orbital motion routine from logos-test.  
logos-funk trialed a 'pedagogical design pattern'. It sucked!  
logos-funk made the costs of following other people's appeals to metaphysical purity apparent!  
logos-funk made 4 things spin around a thing.
logos-funk overran its schedule by 1 entire day :(  
# instructions for use
like all of the early-SQCU autopedagogies circa 2020, running logos-funk is easy!
